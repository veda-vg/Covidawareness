  The recent outbreak of Covid-19, its impact and the uncertainty that it brings can cause concern, anxiety and fear.
   During the current Circuit Breaker, what can we do to keep ourselves and others around us safe and sane? 
  </p>
  <p class="py-2 mx-2">
   For those who are Psychological First Aid (PFA) trained,
    this is a good time to put what you have learned to good use! 
  </p>
  <p class="py-2 mx-2">
  Here are some PFA action principles of Look, Listen and Link when offering remote support 
  (providing PFA via phone or online media without physical contact with the person).

            <h2 class="pt-2">Look</h2>
            <p class="py-3">
             The principle of Look in relation to assessing the people’s needs:
            <ul class="mx-2">
              <li>For people seeking practical and emotional support, you may need to establish whether the individual is affected personally by worries,
              by violence, by fear of losing their livelihood, or is he or she a friend or a relative of someone who’s ill</li>
              <li>Understand the situation that they are in: are they in circuit breaker/isolation/quarantine alone or with 
              families? Are they a frontline responder/a patient etc...</li>
              <li>The anxiety that the callers are experiencing - are they afraid of infecting others or their loved ones
              who need their support?</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

       <div class="container  " height="100%">
           <h2 class="py-2">Listen</h2>
           <p class="py-3"> 
           The principle of Listen refers to:
          <ul class="mx-2">
            <li>Pay attention and listen actively </li>
            <li>Accept the person’s feelings </li>
            <li>Try to calm the distressed</li>
            <li>Ask about the person’s needs and concerns </li>
            <li>Help them find solutions to their needs and problems</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

        <div class="container  " height="100%">
            <h2 class="py-2">Link</h2>
            <p class="py-3">
            The principle of Link refers to assisting the individual with:
            <ul class="mx-2">
              <li>Access to information</li>
              <li>Connecting with loved ones and social support</li>
              <li>Tackling practical problems </li>
              <li>Accessing essential services and other help.</li>
            </ul>

<div class="container border my-3 py-2 px-3">
  <h3 class="py-3">Refer to specialised psychological help if the person seeking help:</h3>
  <ul class="mx-3">
            <li>Has not been able to sleep for a week and is confused and disorientated </li>
            <li>Is so stressed that he or she is unable to function normally and self care (eg. not eating or maintaining personal hygiene)</li>
