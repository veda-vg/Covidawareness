We are in the midst of the one of the severest humanitarian crisis in a century.With the surge in the second wave, a disastrous tragedy is unfolding in India,especially in the lives of the vulnerable communities who are battling the virus as well as daily survival,at the worst ever happening. Millions have been rendered homeless and without a livelihood,with quality care of their children compromised.</p>
<p>Children are at a far greater risk as the second wave of Covid 19 strikes India. Fear of getting infected with Covid-19,anxiety to succumb to the virus, concern for an infected relative, and the thought of losing a loved oneto this virus this is the current state of mind for most of us.</p>
<p>In these trying times SOS Children's Villages of India expresses solidarity with the people to fight COVID -19 as well as to reach out and support to the best of our ability.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the country, all in terms of scale, speed of spread and impact, as a measure of response, SOS Children's Villages of India has developed different strategies to cater to the emerging health and humanitarian crisis among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children, families and communities,while ensuring that all the children under our care too remain safe and secure.
